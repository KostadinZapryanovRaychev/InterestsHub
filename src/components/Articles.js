            title: "Socrates (469—399 B.C.E.)" ,
            description:  "Socrates is one of the few individuals whom one could say has so-shaped the cultural and intellectual development of the world that, without him, history would be profoundly different.  He is best known for his association with the Socratic method of question and answer, his claim that he was ignorant (or aware of his own absence of knowledge), and his claim that the unexamined life is not worth living, for human beings. He was the inspiration for Plato, the thinker widely held to be the founder of the Western philosophical tradition.  Plato in turn served as the teacher of Aristotle, thus establishing the famous triad of ancient philosophers: Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.  Unlike other philosophers of his time and ours, Socrates never wrote anything down but was committed to living simply and to interrogating the everyday views and popular opinions of those in his home city of Athens.  At the age of 70, he was put to death at the hands of his fellow citizens on charges of impiety and corruption of the youth.  His trial, along with the social and political context in which occurred, has warranted as much treatment from historians and classicists as his arguments and methods have from philosophers.This article gives an overview of Socrates: who he was, what he thought, and his purported method.  It is both historical and philosophical.  At the same time, it contains reflections on the difficult nature of knowing anything about a person who never committed any of his ideas to the written word.  Much of what is known about Socrates comes to us from Plato, although Socrates appears in the works of other ancient writers as well as those who follow Plato in the history of philosophy.  This article recognizes that finding the original Socrates may be impossible, but it attempts to achieve a close approximation."

            title: "Plato (427—347 B.C.E.)" ,
            description : " Plato is one of the world’s best known and most widely read and studied philosophers. He was the student of Socrates and the teacher of Aristotle, and he wrote in the middle of the fourth century B.C.E. in ancient Greece. Though influenced primarily by Socrates, to the extent that Socrates is usually the main character in many of Plato’s writings, he was also influenced by Heraclitus, Parmenides, and the Pythagoreans.There are varying degrees of controversy over which of Plato’s works are authentic, and in what order they were written, due to their antiquity and the manner of their preservation through time. Nonetheless, his earliest works are generally regarded as the most reliable of the ancient sources on Socrates, and the character Socrates that we know through these writings is considered to be one of the greatest of the ancient philosophers.Plato’s middle to later works, including his most famous work, the Republic, are generally regarded as providing Plato’s own philosophy, where the main character in effect speaks for Plato himself. These works blend ethics, political philosophy, moral psychology, epistemology, and metaphysics into an interconnected and systematic philosophy. It is most of all from Plato that we get the theory of Forms, according to which the world we know through the senses is only an imitation of the pure, eternal, and unchanging world of the Forms. Plato’s works also contain the origins of the familiar complaint that the arts work by inflaming the passions, and are mere illusions. We also are introduced to the ideal of “Platonic love:” Plato saw love as motivated by a longing for the highest Form of beauty—The Beautiful Itself, and love as the motivational power through which the highest of achievements are possible. Because they tended to distract us into accepting less than our highest potentials, however, Plato mistrusted and generally advised against physical expressions of love."

            title: "Aristotle (384 B.C.E.—322 B.C.E.)" ,
            description : " Aristotle is a towering figure in ancient Greek philosophy, who made important contributions to logic, criticism, rhetoric, physics, biology, psychology, mathematics, metaphysics, ethics, and politics. He was a student of Plato for twenty years but is famous for rejecting Plato’s theory of forms. He was more empirically minded than Plato and Plato’s teacher, Socrates.A prolific writer, lecturer, and polymath, Aristotle radically transformed most of the topics he investigated. In his lifetime, he wrote dialogues and as many as 200 treatises, of which only 31 survive. These works are in the form of lecture notes and draft manuscripts never intended for general readership. Nevertheless, they are the earliest complete philosophical treatises we still possess.As the father of western logic, Aristotle was the first to develop a formal system for reasoning. He observed that the deductive validity of any argument can be determined by its structure rather than its content, for example, in the syllogism: All men are mortal; Socrates is a man; therefore, Socrates is mortal. Even if the content of the argument were changed from being about Socrates to being about someone else, because of its structure, as long as the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. Aristotelian logic dominated until the rise of modern propositional logic and predicate logic 2000 years later.The emphasis on good reasoning serves as the backdrop for Aristotle’s other investigations. In his natural philosophy, Aristotle combines logic with observation to make general, causal claims. For example, in his biology, Aristotle uses the concept of species to make empirical claims about the functions and behavior of individual animals. However, as revealed in his psychological works, Aristotle is no reductive materialist. Instead, he thinks of the body as the matter, and the psyche as the form of each living animal.Though his natural scientific work is firmly based on observation, Aristotle also recognizes the possibility of knowledge that is not empirical. In his metaphysics, he claims that there must be a separate and unchanging being that is the source of all other beings. In his ethics, he holds that it is only by becoming excellent that one could achieve eudaimonia, a sort of happiness or blessedness that constitutes the best kind of human life.Aristotle was the founder of the Lyceum, a school based in Athens, Greece; and he was the first of the Peripatetics, his followers from the Lyceum. Aristotle’s works, exerted tremendous influence on ancient and medieval thought and continue to inspire philosophers to this day."

            description : " Why do people experience pain differently? Qualitative research focuses on experience that we cannot count. It is underpinned by an understanding that the experience of illness is much more than biomedical findings. Qualitative research aims to help us to understand what it is like to be someone else and can allow us to sit alongside our patients (sometimes without fixing). In this way, qualitative research can contribute to a collaborative patient–clinician partnership. This partnership frames the clinician as an advocate and thus has the potential to be equally rewarding for both parties. Qualitative research also aims to challenge our prevailing understanding and to encourage us to ask questions; the world is not always as it appears. This special qualitative edition of the British Journal of Pain provides insight into the experience of pain from a broad range of qualitative approaches. It does not aim to be comprehensive but to encourage readers to explore what qualitative research can add to our understanding of pain, and to spark interest in qualitative research methods.To start this edition, Frank’s seminal paper explores the central place of people’s stories in the experience and treatment of pain. Morse then gives examples of how qualitative research can be used to delve beneath the superficial to find out what is really going on. Gooberman-Hill gives an insight into the usefulness of ethnography for understanding pain. Seers outlines how qualitative systematic review can help us to understand what it is like to live with pain. Smith and Osborn’s paper exploring the experience of chronic pain highlights a sobering thought that certain facets of patients’ experience have not changed qualitatively since 1998, namely, some patients with chronic pain still do not feel believed. Ziebland, Lavie-Ajayi and Lucius-Hoene demonstrate how people living with chronic pain can access qualitative findings via the Internet to help them to live with their pain. Toye and Jenkins explore the use of qualitative research in pain education. Finally, Barker illustrates the usefulness of qualitative research findings for redesigning and commissioning healthcare services.Warmest thanks to all the contributors who took the time to be part of this special edition. I have been overwhelmed by their generous contributions, particularly those who responded to my ‘cold calls’. I would encourage the British Journal of Pain to continue to review and include qualitative research. Thanks also to Professors Michelle Briggs, Nick Allcock and Eloise Carr for contributing their ideas to this project at the outset. The challenge for qualitative health researchers is now to present accessible research findings that can have a real impact on clinical practice.\nFrancine Toye "

            title: "For Math Fans: A Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Number 42" ,
            description : " Everyone loves unsolved mysteries. Examples include Amelia Earhart’s disappearance over the Pacific in 1937 and the daring escape of inmates Frank Morris and John and Clarence Anglin from Alcatraz Island in California in 1962. Moreover our interest holds even if the mystery is based on a joke. Take author Douglas Adams’s popular 1979 science-fiction novel The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, the first in a series of five. Toward the end of the book, the supercomputer Deep Thought reveals that the answer to the “Great Question” of “Life, the Universe and Everything” is “forty-two.”Deep Thought takes 7.5 million years to calculate the answer to the ultimate question. The characters tasked with getting that answer are disappointed because it is not very useful. Yet, as the computer points out, the question itself was vaguely formulated. To find the correct statement of the query whose answer is 42, the computer will have to build a new version of itself. That, too, will take time. The new version of the computer is Earth. To find out what happens next, you’ll have to read Adams’s books.The author’s choice of the number 42 has become a fixture of geek culture. It’s at the origin of a multitude of jokes and winks exchanged between initiates. If, for example, you ask your search engine variations of the question “What is the answer to everything?” it will most likely answer “42.” Try it in French or German. You’ll often get the same answer whether you use Google, Qwant, Wolfram Alpha (which specializes in calculating mathematical problems) or the chat bot Web app Cleverbot.Jean-Paul Delahaye "

            title: "Quantum Mechanics" ,
            description : " Quantum mechanics is, at least at first glance and at least in part, a mathematical machine for predicting the behaviors of microscopic particles — or, at least, of the measuring instruments we use to explore those behaviors — and in that capacity, it is spectacularly successful: in terms of power and precision, head and shoulders above any theory we have ever had. Mathematically, the theory is well understood; we know what its parts are, how they are put together, and why, in the mechanical sense (i.e., in a sense that can be answered by describing the internal grinding of gear against gear), the whole thing performs the way it does, how the information that gets fed in at one end is converted into what comes out the other. The question of what kind of a world it describes, however, is controversial; there is very little agreement, among physicists and among philosophers, about what the world is like according to quantum mechanics. Minimally interpreted, the theory describes a set of facts about the way the microscopic world impinges on the macroscopic one, how it affects our measuring instruments, described in everyday language or the language of classical mechanics. Disagreement centers on the question of what a microscopic world, which affects our apparatuses in the prescribed manner, is, or even could be, like intrinsically; or how those apparatuses could themselves be built out of microscopic parts of the sort the theory describes.That is what an interpretation of the theory would provide: a proper account of what the world is like according to quantum mechanics, intrinsically and from the bottom up. The problems with giving an interpretation (not just a comforting, homey sort of interpretation, i.e., not just an interpretation according to which the world isn’t too different from the familiar world of common sense, but any interpretation at all) are dealt with in other sections of this encyclopedia. Here, we are concerned only with the mathematical heart of the theory, the theory in its capacity as a mathematical machine, and — whatever is true of the rest of it — this part of the theory makes exquisitely good sense."

            title: "Spooky actions at a distance" ,
            description : "One of the strangest aspects of quantum physics is entanglement: If you observe a particle in one place, another particle—even one light-years away—will instantly change its properties, as if the two are connected by a mysterious communication channel. Scientists have observed this phenomenon in tiny objects such as atoms and electrons. But in two new studies, researchers report seeing entanglement in devices nearly visible to the naked eye.There really is an interesting open question, which is: ‘How far can you go up in scale?says Andrew Armour, a physicist at the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom who wasn’t involved in the work. The advance could also pave the way for ultrasensitive measurements of gravity and a hack-proof quantum internet.Albert Einstein colorfully dismissed quantum entanglement—the ability of separated objects to share a condition or state—as spooky action at a distance.Over the past few decades, however, physicists have demonstrated the reality of spooky action over ever greater distances—even from Earth to a satellite in space. But the entangled particles have typically been tiny, which makes it easier to shield their delicate quantum states from the noisy world.Two research groups have now scaled up entanglement to engineered objects barely visible to the naked eye. Simon Gröblacher, a physicist at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, and his colleagues etched beams about 10 micrometers long into silicon chips. The beams, roughly the size of a bacterium, could oscillate up and down like a plucked guitar string. The researchers connected the chips with an optical fiber and cooled the whole setup close to absolute zero to damp out vibrations. Then, using cleverly controlled laser pulses, the team added just enough energy to get one beam vibrating a bit more strongly than the other. By measuring light coming out of the apparatus, the researchers verified that the energy boost occurred but did not learn which beam got the energy, meaning that the added energy was shared by both beams—the hallmark of quantum entanglement. The delicate entangled state lasted just a fraction of a second, the group reports today in Nature.Mika Sillanpää, a physicist at Aalto University in Finland, and his colleagues took a different approach, manufacturing pairs of aluminum drum heads, or vibrating disks, about the width of a human hair onto a silicon chip. After cooling the setup, the researchers used microwaves to nudge the drum heads into correlated motions—as one throbbed up and down, the other did the opposite. A second set of microwave pulses probed the motions, and an analysis of the signals showed the drum heads shared a single quantum state, the team reports in a second Nature paper.When we took the data, we had no idea if we were entangled or not,” Sillanpää says. “It turns out the answer was ‘yes.The entanglement can last indefinitely, he says—as long as the drum heads stay immersed in their microwave bath.The two setups have different potential applications. Gröblacher designed his beams to vibrate at the same rate as light sent through fiber-optics, to make them compatible with existing telecommunications systems. The setup is “completely engineerable,” Gröblacher says. If he can get the entangled states to last longer and increase the distance between chips, he envisions such devices serving as nodes in an eventual quantum internet that could transmit ultrasecure information between future quantum-enabled computers.Sillanpää says his drumheads may be better suited to precision measurement. Because quantum sensors are so sensitive, they excel at picking up extremely weak signals such as gravitational waves, the space-time ripples that were recently detected for the first time. As the devices get larger, they could also test theories of gravity that extend Einstein’s general theory of relativity into the quantum realm, connecting two areas of physics that have remained stubbornly separate.Both experiments have pros and cons, says John Teufel, a physicist at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder, Colorado. The entanglement of Gröblacher’s beams was short-lived, but it was detected with certainty. Sillanpää’s entanglement was longer-lasting, but his team needed a complicated chain of theoretical reasoning to infer that the drum heads’ motions were truly entangled. “Ideally what you’d want … is a little bit of both,” Teufel says. Regardless, he says, the results are “very exciting first steps. "

            title: "The forgotten story of ... Carlos Kaiser, football's greatest conman" ,
            description : "  A new film tells the story of Carlos Kaiser, who was one of the most famous footballers in Brazil for over 20 years – even though he had no intention of ever kicking a bal.You might know the voiceover at the start of The Big Lebowski. As tumbleweed meanders through Los Angeles, Sam Elliott introduces us to the film’s main character: “Goes by the name of Jeff Lebowski. At least that was the handle his loving parents gave him, but he never had much use for it himself. See, this Lebowski, he called himself ‘The Dude’.The Stranger rambles on about this and that until he gets somewhere near the point. “Sometimes, there’s a man. And I’m talkin’ about the Dude here - the Dude from Los Angeles. Sometimes, there’s a man; well, he’s the man for his time and place. He fits right in there. And that’s the Dude.” The forgotten story of ... Dundee United's glory years under Jim McLean.It’s also Kaiser, in Rio de Janeiro, in the 1980s and 1990s. Carlos Henrique Raposo was the handle his parents gave him but he never had much use for that. This Raposo, he called himself “Kaiser”. And in one ostentatiously bemulleted package, he embodied the roguish charm of one of the world’s most soulful cities. “Rio de Janeiro is a special state,” says Joel Santana, the coach who has won the state championship (the Campeonato Carioca) with all four of Rio’s main clubs. “Cariocas (natives of Rio) are more free, relaxed, fun. The environment is conducive to it. A lot of beach. A lot of samba. A lot of drums. You get into the groove without knowing. A good Carioca is somebody who knows how to live life.”the lack of beaches sapped his spirit. The rest of his career was spent in Brazil. Even though the team that won the World Cup in 1994 is remembered with an asterisk because of their conservative style of play, domestic football was as expressive as ever. This was a team when Jogo Bonito was a philosophy rather than an advertising slogan.In 1995, during a particularly glamorous race for the Rio state championship, Renato, Romário and Túlio had a playful, ongoing public argument about who was the King of Rio. Renato won the argument with his legendary “belly goal” to win the final of the Campeonato Carioca for Fluminense against Romário’s Flamengo. There was another contender for the crown. These days Kaiser is in his 50s and works as a fitness trainer for women – but his legend endures. “Those three were just squabbling,” says Alexandre Torres. “They wanted to usurp a guy who was impossible to dethrone. The real king of Rio was Kaiser.” "
